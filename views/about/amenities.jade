            | In the spring of 1797 Robert Mitchell and his wife Harriett purchased Lot #19 from the town of Jonesborough. This two story dwelling was built on a stone foundation, logs were used for floor joists, and the dwelling was of mortise and tenon frame. The interior surfaces were wide plank walls, floors, and ceilings. Four fireplaces provided heat and the exterior was covered with clapboard and the roof was shake shingles.

            | Fast forward 200 years, in the spring of 1997 the hotel was purchased by a small group of residents in Jonesborough. These investors wanted to see this beautiful old hotel restored back to its days of glory. A great deal of time and expense went into the planning process. The challenge was to preserve the charm of the hotel while blending in the amenities expected by the discerning traveler. Three years and almost three million dollars later, the Eureka reopened under the original name, offering the best of the past and the present. All guestrooms are decorated with a combination of period antiques and elegant reproductions.
