        | Our wide open front and back porches feature comfortable seating tailor-made for relaxation. Just off our back porches overlooking Little Limestone Creek we created a special landscaped private garden with a gazebo and brick patio. All perfect settings for a quiet moment alone, a boisterous gathering of friends and family, or anything in-between.
